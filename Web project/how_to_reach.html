    <p style="text-align: center;">The political hub of the region, Bengaluru is a world apart from the rest of the
      state and in many ways India’s
      most Westernized urban centre. Once a sleepy cantonment, the charming, verdant “Garden City” of just over 600,0000
      people at Independence has been completely transformed by the technology boom into both a trendy, racy business
      hub and a bustling, smog-choked megalopolis of nearly twelve million, perhaps the fastest growing city in India.

        <h1>By Road:</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
          Bnaglore being one of the most Important city of South India is very well conncted by roads. It is one of the
          major cities in the Golden Quadrilateral. The NH4 running between Mumbai to Chennai runs between the city, NH7
          the longest National Highway of India runing between Varanasi and Kanyakumari passes through the city. Also
          there are many other NHs, SHs, connecting Bangalore to surrounding cities. To avoid congestion in the city and
          avoid traffic, NICE Road has been been very beautifully around the city. The 6-lane roads are very well
          maintained which collects though give a great service. One can easily get out of the city or ply from one
          corner to other easily within no time. Being one of the busiest city in the world, traffic is one of the major
          problem. Many flyovers, main roads do exists in bangalore, but traffic becomes major problem specially during
          weekends and evenings. So, it's better to plan accordingly. Reaching Bangalore by road is not a great deal at
          all. Major well maintained roads to exists for reaching Bangalore from all all the surrounding places.
