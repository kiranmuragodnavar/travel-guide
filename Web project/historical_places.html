                <br>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;">The silicon valley of India, Bangalore adorns the majestic Bangalore Fort,
                    also known as Tipu Sultan’s fort that stands testament to the rich history of the Kingdom of Mysore
                    and is a powerful edifice of Indian history. The fort takes you through the different architecture
                    styles, their influences and evolution and has its own share of history engraved deeply in the
                    fascinating stone structure.
                    <br><br>
                    It represents the architectural creativity and brilliance of the Mysore rulers and is one of the
                    most popular monuments in India, that still does not fail to mesmerize the spectators.

                <div>
                    <p style="font-size: 15px;">
                        This palace was spectacular, being built completely from teak. To see a two-storey building such
                        as this built entirely from wood and so demonstratively decorated and carved was truly something
                        else.
                        <br><br>
                        Whilst most of the fort is in a state of ruin, the palace has been quite well preserved. The
                        columns are plentiful and sit under such beautiful carved archways. Stone staircases lead
                        upstairs to a central open area, used as the durbar by the Sultan to receive his special guests.

                        Folks who seek to experience the classic royal charm of Bangalore can head over to one of its
                        older landmarks, the sprawling Tudor-inspired estate of Bangalore Palace. The palace was built
                        in the year 1887 by King Chamaraja Wadiyar and is today open to the public who come to witness
                        the lavish and elegant splendour of one of South India’s most enduring dynasties.
                        <br><br>
                        The Palace is home to many renowned 19th and 20th century paintings, including those by Raja
                        Ravi Varma, one of India’s most famous painters. There is a large collection of photographs that
                        chronicle the different generations of the Wadiyar dynasty along with offering a glimpse into
                        the evolution of Bangalore over the last century.

                <p style="font-size: 15px;">
                    Influenced by the House of Commons in London, the Vidhana Soudha is spread over 60 acres of land. It
                    is popularly known as the building that houses the State Legislature Assembly and the Secretariat of
                    Karnataka. The foundation stone of Vidhana Soudha was laid down by the first Prime Minister of
                    India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, in 1951.
                    <br><br>
                    It has been described by many dignitaries in many different ways over the years. Inaugurated on
                    October 10, 1956, Vidhana Soudha is the original seat of power in the state of Karnataka. The
                    construction of such a building was due to the immense amount of nationalist sentiments that were
                    growing amongst people soon after India gained its independence. During that time, the
                    administrative offices were based out of Attara Kacheri, built by the British in 1868.

                <br>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;">The Bull Temple in Bangalore, also known as Nandi Temple, is famous for its
                    large statue of the sacred bull, Nandi. In fact, with a height of around 4.6 metres and a length of
                    about 6.1 metres, the idol of Nandi in this temple is said to be one of the biggest in the world.
                    This unique feature attracts many devotees and tourists to the place.
                    <br><br>


                    Nandi, meaning ‘joy’ in Sanskrit, is the sacred bull according to Hindu beliefs. Though the Nandi
                    statue appears to be black in color, it was not really the case when it was built. The idol was
                    originally grey in color. But as devotees continuously applied charcoal and oil to the statue, it
                    blackened over the years.

                    It is one of the most popular places of worship in Bangalore City. Sri Banashankari Devi is also
                    known as Shakambari. The Devotees have a strong belief in the goddess and fulfill desires for
                    prayers done in true sincerity.
                    <br><br>The belief in the goddess is so strong and a huge number of devotees
                    visit this temple every day. In 1915, the temple was founded by Basappa Shetty, a devotee of Goddess
                    Banashankari. Banashankari Amma Temple is one of the very famous temples in Bangalore, not because
                    of the temple looks but because of the beliefs, surrounded by the temple.

                    church – with a vaulted ceiling supported by Corinthian pillars, splendid arches and stained-glass
                    windows would leave you absolutely wonderstruck. St Mary, also known as Our Lady of Health is said
                    to possess miraculous powers and draws thousands of devotees for the feast in September. In 1974 the
                    Pope elevated the church to the status of a Basilica.
                    <br><br>
                    St Mary’s Basilica celebrates its annual feast on 8th September, the birthday of St
                    Mary.
                    St Mary’s Basilica is located in Shivaji Nagar, 5 kms from Bengaluru city centre (Majestic) and 34
