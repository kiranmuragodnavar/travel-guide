                        alike. Sprawling across an area over 1200 sq.ft, it is situated in one of the well known
                        localities of Bangalore, J.C Nagar. Opened in 2012 at Fun World Complex, Snow city is one of the
                        largest indoor snow parks in South India.
                        <br></br>
                        Snow city, Bangalore is an escapade from the scorching summers and a whole new experience from
                        what we come across generally. Here one can get a feel of chilling winter all around the year,

                        one can have a ball while playing in snow, which is edible and eco-friendly to one’s delight.

                        Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium in Bangalore is a popular attraction in the city that is
                        administered by the Bangalore Association for Science Education (BASE). From how stars form to
                        how planets evolve, from the origin of
                        life to human's space expeditions, from how gravity works to how eclipses happen - the
                        planetarium explains it all. The Sky Theatre is its main attraction in this place.
                        <br><br>
                        Mainly it facilitates the educational institutes which can bring their students here
                        for an academic excursion with prior booking. The children get to learn things outside the
                        classrooms and also enjoy a day out with friends. The place is a fascinating hub of knowledge
                        but not in a textbook manner; but rather in a more intriguing and practical way which explains
                        the concepts much better than theory.

                    approximately 1.5 kms and has 2 springs which are now covered with heavy silt.
                    Once a popular recreational site of the Mysore Wadiyars, this lake is still quite popular amongst
